## Lists

### 2016

This repository is a way for me to catalog and organize some useful and amazing repositories that I found there. But this idea came from that [wonderful repository](https://github.com/fbeegle/discovery-log) of [fbeegle](https://github.com/fbeegle/).

* :calendar: [April](https://github.com/danilovaz/discovery-day/blob/master/2016/april.md)

## Lists organization

Lists is organized by months and the items inside it is separated according to the date of discovery and will be indicated as follows:

- :coffee: - back-end
